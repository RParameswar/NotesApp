What is Node.js - A runtime enviroment allowing you to use js on you computer.
Usually you can only us js on the browser which has a compiler V8 which uses
your computers resources to run the code. This is different than 
having a companies server constantly ping you simple changes everytime something
happens. Also because js runs on the browser there are security restrictions which 
make it so it can access part of you computer without asking or limit the things it 
can do. With Node.js you can run js on your computer accessing anything you want. Also 
npm standing for (node package manager) is a repository with packages which do things. 
Its like github has stuff in js you can use without needing to do I yourself. It also 
helps with downloading dependences. So if you have a file with a package it imports which 
relies on another package etc npm when giving the code to another perosn will download 
everthing necessary
